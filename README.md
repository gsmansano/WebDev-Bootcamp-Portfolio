# WebDev Bootcamp Portfolio

This repository is a collection of projects, capstones, and selected exercises completed during my Full Stack Web Development studies. It serves both as a portfolio of my progress and a central place to organize work across different technologies.

## About This Repository

I am currently following a full stack web development curriculum that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, APIs, databases, EJS, React, and more.  
As I progress, I will add capstone projects and any exercises or challenges that feel meaningful or showcase useful concepts.

## Projects Included

### 1. Capstone – Fake Quote Generator (API Usage)
A small project focused on calling external APIs, handling JSON responses, and rendering data dynamically.  
**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, APIs, EJS.

*More capstones and exercises will be added over time.*

## Purpose

This repo acts as:
- A portfolio of my evolving skills  
- A structured place to track projects  
- A way to improve version control and Git workflow  
- A reference for future personal projects  

## Structure

Each project lives in its own folder with:
- Its own README  
- Source files  
- Any assets or dependencies  
- Notes when needed  

## Future Additions

Planned upcoming additions include:
- Additional API-based capstones  
- React mini-projects  
- SQL and database exercises  
- Full-stack capstones

# WebDev Bootcamp Portfolio

This repository is a collection of projects, capstones, and selected exercises completed during my Full Stack Web Development studies. It serves both as a portfolio of my progress and a central place to organize work across different technologies.

## About This Repository

I am currently following a full stack web development curriculum that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, APIs, databases, EJS, React, and more.  
As I progress, I will add capstone projects and any exercises or challenges that feel meaningful or showcase useful concepts.

## Projects Included

### 1. Mangaboxd – Manga Review & Tracking App (Full-Stack CRUD)
A personal manga journal and review aggregator inspired by Letterboxd. This is a full-stack application that manages a local database while communicating with external anime/manga APIs.
* **Key Features:** RESTful routing, search integration via Jikan (MyAnimeList) API, persistent PostgreSQL storage, and a "smart" editor for creating/updating reviews.
* **Tech used:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, EJS, Axios, CSS Flexbox/Grid.

### 2. Capstone – Fake Quote Generator (API Usage)
A project focused on asynchronous programming, calling external APIs, handling JSON responses, and rendering data dynamically to the frontend.  
**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, APIs, EJS.

*More capstones and exercises will be added over time.*
